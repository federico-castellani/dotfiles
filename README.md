## üîß Installation

1. Clone the repository to your home directory
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Copy or symlink configuration files to appropriate directories:
   - `~/.config/waybar/`
   - `~/.config/rofi/`
   - `~/.config/wlogout/`
4. Make scripts executable: `chmod +x waybar/scripts/* rofi/applets/bin/*`
5. Configure paths in your shell profile if needed

## üìù Configuration Notes

- Optimized for modern Wayland compositors
- Scripts include fallback configurations for standalone usage
- Power management features require appropriate systemd permissions
- Audio controls use ALSA mixer (amixer) by default
- Theme detection works with standard Linux theming systems

## üéõÔ∏è Customization

### Waybar Modules
Easily customize which modules appear in your status bar by editing the configuration files. Each module is self-contained and can be enabled/disabled independently.

### Rofi Themes
Multiple built-in themes available for different visual preferences. Switch between them by modifying the theme variable in the applet scripts.

### Color Schemes
Automatic color detection from wallpapers with fallback to manual color scheme definitions.

This configuration provides a cohesive desktop environment with powerful customization options and seamless integration between components, designed to work independently without external theme management dependencies.
